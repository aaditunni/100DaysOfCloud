# FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp Week 4 Part 5

## Cloud Research

Today, I completed the Week 4 of the FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp by Andrew Brown.

The rest of Week 4 was to create a new activities with a database insert. Basically, when we log in to ou cruddur account, we get to post our own cruds in our homepage. I implemented it but got an error and couldn't figure out why so will be asking the discord group for help and updating it in my repo.
