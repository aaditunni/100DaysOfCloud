# DevOps Challenge

## Cloud Research

Today, I tried to do a challenge where I need to configure AWS AMI on my local machine using Oracle VirtualBox and then install LAMP on it using the user-data option. I tried to create my own seed.iso file using user-data and meta-data, downloaded the Amazon Linux 2 AMI and booted it on VirtualBox but couldn't log in showing login incorrect error. Tried using the official seed.iso by Amazon and still ended up getting the same error. Asked a friend to test it out and apparently he was able to log in but got another error which was not having internet access and wasn't able to install LAMP. Will find out what the issue is and try to get it done another day.
