# AWS UG Dubai Meetup #28

## Cloud Research

Today, I attended the AWS User Group Dubai Meetup #28 where two AWSome speakers presented on Building applications easily using AWS Amplify and Deep Dive on DynamoDB.

In this session, I learnt:
- About the AWS service Amplify and how it can be used to build a full stack form/application within minutes including the cloud infrastructure on AWS Amplify along with a small demo. 
- Key concepts of DynamoDB, how the service works under the hood and how to ensure your DynamoDB tables deliver the required throughput needed for your application along with the other features it provides.

Also, met some familiar as well as some new faces and had a fun time networking and catching up with them.
