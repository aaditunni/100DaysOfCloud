## Aadit's Cloud Journey

Hi, I am Aadit! I am a Computer Science Engineering graduate passionate about cloud computing, the new possibilities it holds and the new doors it opens for me.

I started this challenge to develop my skills and learn from the community. I am working towards a career in cloud computing. I have already achieved serveral certifications including :
AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner and AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate

By the end of the challenge, I would like to assure myself that I have gained a lot of knowledge, skills and I am ready for more certifications as well as ready for my first job!

These challenges or projects may or may not cost you money. If it's under free tier, I will be mentioning 'AWS free tier account' under Prerequisite and if it costs money or I am not sure about whether it will incur charges or not, I'll be mentioning only 'AWS account' under Prerequisite.
