# Dubai Kubernetes Meetup

## Cloud Research

Today, I attended the first meetup of the Dubai Kubernetes community. I learned about the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), the state of containers which is about the past of containers and orchestrations as well as an introduction to Docker and Kubernetes.
