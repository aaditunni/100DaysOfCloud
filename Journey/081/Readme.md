# FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp Week 5 Part 2

## Cloud Research

Today, I did a part of the Week 5 of the FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp by Andrew Brown.

Here's what I completed:
- I figured what the error was for my Week 4 when implementing create activity. Apparently, the user in my cognito and in my database where different. Once I deleted the the previous user and created a new one, then it started working properly and I could post cruds/posts.

- Watched Week 5 - Live Streamed Video - NoSQL and Caching where more about messaging was discussed.
 - A user wants to see a list of messages that belong to a message group The messages must be ordered by the created_at timestamp from newest to oldest (DESC).
 - A user wants to see a list of previous conversations. These conversations are listed from newest to oldest (DESC) We want to see the other person we are talking to. We want to see the last message (from whomever) in summary.
 - Create a message.
 - When a user creates a message we need to update the conversation to display the last message information for the conversation.
