# FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp Week 6 Part 3

## Cloud Research

Today, I did a part of the Week 6 of the FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp by Andrew Brown.

Here's what was left that I completed:
- Create ECR repo and push image for backend-flask.
    - Log in to ECR.
    - Create a repo in ECR.
    - Set/Export the environment variable.
    - Pull the image from docker and push it to ECR backend flask repo.
- Create ECR repo and push image for backend-flask.
    - Create a repo in ECR.
    - Set/Export the environment variable.
    - Build the image and push it to ECR backend flask repo.
- Deploy Backend Flask app as a service to Fargate.
- Passing Sensitive Data (environment variables like Access key, Secret key, etc) to Task Definition in Parameter Store in Systems Manager.

All of them were done through the cli.
