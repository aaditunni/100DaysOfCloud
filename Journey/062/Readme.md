# FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp Week 2 Part 1

## Cloud Research

Today, I completed a part of the Week 2 of the FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp by Andrew Brown.

Here's what I completed:
- Watch Week 2 Live-Stream Video.
- Instrument our backend flask application to use Open Telemetry (OTEL) with Honeycomb.io as the provider.
- Run queries to explore traces within Honeycomb.io.
- Watched Ashish's Week 2 - Observability Security Considerations which also explains Observability vs Monitoring in AWS.
