## Try yourself

### Step 1 —
Search Lex and click 'Create bot'. You can create a bot with an example bot that has pre-configured languages, intent, etc but for this I am creating a blank bot with nothing pre-configured.
- Give a name, create a new IAM role and add a language. The voice interaction is given None as it is a chatbot and then click Done.

### Step 2 — 
Create a New Intent.
- In the sample utterances, add an utterance which is basically what a user like us would ask the bot.
- Un the Initial Response, add a response message to the above utterance which is basically what the bot would respond to your input and then save the intent
