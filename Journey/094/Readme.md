# FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp Week 6 Part 2

## Cloud Research

Today, I did a part of the Week 6 of the FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp by Andrew Brown.

Here's what was left that I completed:
- Add a test script into db directory so we can easily check our connection from our container.
- Create a new bin script at bin/flask/health-check for health checks.
- Deploy an ECS Cluster using ECS Service Connect

All of them were done through the cli.
