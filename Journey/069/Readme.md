# FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp Week 3 Part 2

## Cloud Research

Today, I completed a part of the Week 3 of the FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp by Andrew Brown.

Here's what I completed:
- Implement API calls to Amazon Cognito for custom signup Page.
- Implement API calls to Amazon Cognito for confirmation page.
- Implement API calls to Amazon Cognito for recovery page.
- Implement API calls to Amazon Cognito for forgot password page.

By doing this, I was able to create a custom sign up page, through which I was ale to implement API calls t Amazon Cognito and create an User. When an user us created, it sends a confirmation code to our email which is used to confirm our newly created account. When you log in using that credentials, it logs us to our newly created user. We can also reset the password in case we forget out password using the Forgot password option.
