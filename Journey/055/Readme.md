# FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp Week 1 Part 1

## Cloud Research

Today, I completed a part of the Week 1 of the FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp by Andrew Brown.

Here's what I completed:
- Containerized the Backend and the Frontend (Created a Dockerfile and built the Container).
- Created a Docker compose file which is helpful to run multiple containers. Here it was used to run both the frontend and the backend containers.

By doing this, I was able to view the Webpage of the web application, sign up and create a new user as well as log in with that newly created user.
