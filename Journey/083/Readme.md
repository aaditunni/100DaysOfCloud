# FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp Week 5 Part 4

## Cloud Research

Today, I did a part of the Week 5 of the FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp by Andrew Brown.

Here's what I completed:
- I completed implementing the code for Pattern A, B and C but ended up with an error. I think the error is due to the cognito user and the user in the local being different or something. I will be checking on it tomorrow and updating it here with pictures once solved.
    - Implement Update Cognito ID Script for Postgres Database.
    - Implement (Pattern A) Listing Messages in Message Group into Application.
    - Implement (Pattern B) Listing Messages Group into Application.
    - Implement (Pattern C) Creating a Message for an existing Message Group into Application.
    - Implement (Pattern D) Creating a Message for a new Message Group into Application.
