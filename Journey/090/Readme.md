# FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp Week 5 Part 6

## Cloud Research

Today, I completed the Week 5 of the FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp by Andrew Brown.

Here's what was left that I completed:
- Implement (Pattern E) Updating a Message Group using DynamoDB Streams. 

This week was quite difficult and took me a lot of days to complete. I am lagging behind Week 6 as well. There was lot to implement and there were quite a lot of errors and took days to get it fixed especially because I had got help from others a bit slower. It was one hectic week. Tried solving one error and another one pops up. In the end, I am happy to complete it.
