# FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp

## Cloud Research

Today, I completed a part of the Week 3 of the FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp by Andrew Brown.

Here's what I completed:
- Watched the Week 3 Live-Stream Video.
- Setup a Cognito User Pool.
- Implement Custom Signin Page.
- Implemented the error message part when incorrect login details are provided.

By doing this, I was able to create a custom sign in page and a cognito user pool. One can only login with the credentials of a user created in Cognito and anything else will show an error message.
