# FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp Week 6 Part 5

## Cloud Research

Today, I did a part of the Week 6 of the FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp by Andrew Brown.

Here's what was left that I completed:
- Create Services for backend that includes Service Connect.
- Update RDS SG to allow access for the ECS security group.
- Install Sessions Manager Plugin.
- Connect to the ECS container cluster using Sessions Manager (Fargate).

By completing these, I have completed the backend portion of deploying the container.
