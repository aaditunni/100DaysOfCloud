# FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp Week 3 Part 4

## Cloud Research

Today, I completed the Week 3 of the FREE AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp by Andrew Brown.

The rest of Week 3 was to debug and solve the error and tweak the CSS to make the UI better. I had asked the bootcampers on the AWS Virtual User Group Discord channel for help and happened to debug and solve the problem. It was a mistake in the variable name. It was  AWS_COGNITO_USERPOOL_ID in my app.py file and AWS_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID in my docker compose file and that caused the issue. Then I made some tweaks to the CSS to make the UI better.
